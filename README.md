# Security Advisory
This repository contains important security information regarding this Offline CheatBreaker Client.

## General Information
* This Offline CheatBreaker is a Minecraft 1.7.10 and 1.8.9 client. The 1.7.10 version uses the CB jar file with minor modifications and bug fixes to keep it up to date, and the 1.8.9 version is a reskin of Lunar Client 1.8.9.
* This Offline CheatBreaker is by no means a virus, or ratted in any way. All allegations saying otherwise are false. We do not recommend downloading any version of this Offline CheatBreaker from anywhere except our [website](https://offlinecheatbreaker.com) and [GitHub](https://github.com/Offline-Cheatbreaker/Client). Many people have created malware while pretending to be Offline CheatBreaker.
* This Offline CheatBreaker is available to the public in a form of a launcher with 1.7.10 and 1.8.9 launch options (We don't provide download links to our jar files).
* All our client jar files are obfuscated (you can check it on 1.7 by opening the jar file with WinRAR or 7-Zip and looking for a `generated` folder).
* We provide cosmetics (capes and wings) for free (Open cosmetics menu to select the cosmetics you want).
* Our only official GitHub repositories are available under this [GitHub organisation account](https://github.com/Offline-Cheatbreaker).
